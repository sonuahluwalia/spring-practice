The Battle of Thermopylae was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states,
led by King Leonidas of Sparta, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I over the
course of three days, during the second Persian invasion of Greece.
It took place simultaneously with the naval battle at Artemisium, in August
or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of Thermopylae.
The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian
invasion of Greece, which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle
of Marathon in 490 BC. Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to
conquer all of Greece.
